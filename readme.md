# Advent of Code - 2024

Hi and welcom to Advent of Code[^aoc] 2024!

This year as a part of trying new language, I'm testing GoLang for my main go-to (hehe) language to solve the AoC puzzles.
Main focus will be on this language, to learn it, explore and see all the pros and cons.

In the same time, I will have a Kotlin as a secondary option. This one I will use when I will have very little time given day,
but still wanting to solve the puzzle. Sometimes I will also solve given puzzle in both languages, because why not? However, 
I will try avoid writing Kotlin in GoLang by reading the discussions and other Go programmers solutions once I will solve given day.
